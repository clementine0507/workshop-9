Add video to workshop7's colorful balls

Remove the original color so that it catch the color of the video

But the ball is running especially slow, so we shrink it by a factor of eighteen.

Then change the number and size of balls

Change the transparency of the ball

#### Processing

The first version of the code according to the video operation.

In the first version, I let the number of stars vary according to the area of the canvas.

Increase the number of stars again and then change the size of the stars

It didn't seem like a big deal anymore, but given that my hair is black, I chose to change the background to white and the transparency of the stars to be reduced.

The video you get this time will clearly show my hair and face.

##### reflection
Throughout these ten assignments, I gradually learned to understand the components of each piece of code and experimented with rearranging them to create new works. For someone with no prior experience, this was undoubtedly a significant challenge. Every time I worked on a new assignment, I often found myself forgetting what I had learned previously, requiring me to constantly refer back to my notes to review and reinforce my understanding. Despite the difficulties, successfully running the code and achieving the expected results was always a rewarding experience.
In the final assignment, I noticed for the first time the tangible visualization of code art and felt that my generated works were gradually aligning with contemporary art. This gave me a new perspective on the creative potential of coding, and I hope that in my future projects, I can achieve the artistic effects I envision.
